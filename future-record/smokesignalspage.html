    History of Smoke Signals
</div>

    <div class="about smoke">
        Long distance communication became very important for individuals to be able to communicate information to each other from certain distances. The use of smoke signals was the first long distance communication method. It was used in Nothern America where each tribe had its own signalling system. A smoke signal from the top a hill meant danger was near and help was needed. Smoke signals were also used in Ancient China. The soldiers stationed at the Great Wall would alert for danger using smoke signals from tower to tower. In this way they could transmit messages as far as 750km within a few hours. In modern day, the use of wireless signals transmit data and information through the air from source to source, making infromation accessible to all with access to an electronic device.
