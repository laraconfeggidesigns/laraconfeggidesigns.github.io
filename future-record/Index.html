         The Transmission of Information
     </div>

     
     <div class="subheading">
         The transmission of information has taken many different forms over history. It is about the process of moving infomation from a source to the user. The usability of information depends on the efficiency and reliability of transmission chanells. In present day, large amounts of information can be spread around the world in seconds. Future methods and undiscovered technology propose a new world of accessing information and knowledge. As technology and communication has become so important in our daily lives, we begin to worship these technological figures that assist us with connecting to others. The future proposes these ideas of becoming obsolete and technology being infused and interwined with us as they influence our decisions and morals and determine the way we interact with others.
